"""Built-in example packages.

These ship as ready-to-deploy packages (seeded on first boot) and double as
starting templates in the Package Builder. They are deliberately benign,
sysadmin-oriented operations — the expected operator is a fleet administrator,
not a robotics developer, so the examples look like everyday fleet chores
(smoke test, diagnostics, remote-access, config) rather than robot code.

Each command runs through the robot's OTA engine as a shell command line.
Commands that redirect or chain are wrapped in `sh -c '...'` so they behave the
same regardless of how the engine invokes them.
